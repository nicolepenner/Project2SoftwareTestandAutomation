# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure my code/program/software is functional and secure by first writing quality code that follows the best practices and guidelines for software development.  I can also make sure that I follow the proper security protocols when writing code. It depends on the level of security you want your code to have, but it helps to make sure the code you're writing can stand up and be secure.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I can interpret user needs by interviewing who will actually be using the program, and taking notes as I interview. My notes and the knowledge I gain can be used to help form the requirments and needed functions. Once I am able to interpret the information - I will be able to create a code that focuses and fulfills all requirements.

# How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by looking at requirments and the necessary functions and building a code around it. Next comes designing the code to run properly and fugure out how you want the code to be structured. The different structures and functions are important because as a developer you need to think about how all separate pieces of code work together, because this will partially dicatate how the software will be designed. The most important thing to consider is the customers requirments, how it will function and meet needs of all parties involved in the most efficient and functional way.
